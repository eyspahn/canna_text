# Neural Nets to Develop New Cannabis Strain Names

### Thanks to [this Practical PyTorch example](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-generation/char-rnn-generation.ipynb) which I more or less copied
### Data from [Leafly via Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains)

## Currently in a jupyter notebook.

### Results
Some real names are generated by the model (Blueberry, Blackberry Kush, OG Kush, Haze all were generated). However, we came up with a few more creative names too. In no particular order, a sampling:

* Hawaiian Beblue
* Ormulange
* Golden Sour
* Big Hound
* Sur-Is
* Sour Shert
* Iced Gold
* OG Wooms
* Sour Indica
* Tumbold
* Pineape Snow
* Blueberry Sklaze
* Jack Cream
* The Cough
* Black Dond Mango Deatical Sour Blook
* Tuna Critus
* Headbangel
* Golden Calyx
* Hawaiian Dick

#### What this is
I applied a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to existing cannabis strain names, to develop a model that generates new strain names. This is based on the probabilities of seeing a character next given a character, that the RNN learned from the training data, in this case, a bunch of samples from Leafly's strain database. If there's interest, I can come up with a better explanation of how it works. Fun stuff!
