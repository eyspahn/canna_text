# Neural Nets to Develop New

## Thanks to [this Practical PyTorch example](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-generation/char-rnn-generation.ipynb) which I more or less copied
## Data from [Leafly via Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains)

## Currently in a jupyter notebook.

### Results
Some real names are generated by the (shitty, first iteration of the) model. Blueberry, Blackberry Kush, OG Kush, Haze all were generated. However, there were a few more creative names generated. In no particular order, a sampling:

Hawaiian Beblue
Ormulange
Golden Sour
Big Hound
Sur-Is
Sour Shert
Iced Gold
OG Wooms
Sour Indica
Tumbold
Pineape Snow
Blueberry Sklaze
Jack Cream
The Cough
Black Dond Mango Deatical Sour Blook
Tuna Critus
Headbangel
Golden Calyx
Hawaiian Dick
